# Summarize any `one` of the following in your own words, A single paragraph would be enough:
- What are Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs), explain in detail?
- What are GPTs? What are features and use cases of custom GPTs?
- What is the Future of Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs)?
- Write a note on OpenAI Custom GPT: A Platform for CUI.
- Can visual elements within Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) can be interactive?


## What are Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs), explain in detail?
Conversational user interface is a type of interface which uses natural language as input in form of text or audio and after analyzing the input, process the information and give output similar to humans.
Chatbot can communicate in form of text , while audio assistant use audio language. In near future it may be possible that humans interact with CUIs in form of videos or 3D Videos as well.
CUI are useful as they improve the human interaction with computers. CUIs can be used in customer care centers, e-commerce stores etc. CUIs can be used in different home appliances.
In future it may be possible that we interact with animals using these CUIs voice assistant.

## What are GPTs? What are features and use cases of custom GPTs?
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a pre-trained model which uses CUIs for conversation with humans. This model is designed by openai firm and it is trained on the data available over internet. OpenAI also facilitates its user buy providing the facility to make custom GPTs. These custom GPTs are created on base model layer and can be used for real time business needs like for making som FAQs section, e-commerce, customer care etc.   

## What is the Future of Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs)?
CUIs in future may be improved to communicate with humans not only in text or audio but also in form of video streaming, 3D Videos etc.

## Can visual elements within Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs) can be interactive?
Of course a blended approach will be fascinating as there are use cases when we cant relay on CUIs only as it may consume more time and can lead to misunderstanding due to unclear conversation of humans through CUI. For example if we want to edit a video and to apply some filters or colors etc , then it will become very difficult to interact through CUIs, or for example you want to choose a specific color shade then it will be easy ti use GUI instead of CUI.
