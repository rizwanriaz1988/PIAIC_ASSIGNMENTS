# Summarize the following in your own words, A single paragraph would be enough:
What are Compound AI Systems?
What are AI Agents?
What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents?
What is the difference between Fine Tuning and RAG?



## What are compound AI systems?
Compound AI system is an AI system which can not just respond in form of text as done in LLM but it also incorporate additional features like generating images using another model like DALL-E, integration with APIs and applications using  different third party apps through actions.


## What are AI Agents?
AI agents were introduced in 2024 which has the ability to iterate over the generated response through different modes. It focuses on the generated response to ensure its accuracy and validity.


## What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents?
Compound AI systems were introduced in 2023 whereas AI agents were introduced in 2024.
AI agents have all the capability of a compound ai system but it has an additional feature regarding validation and authenticity of response through iteration using different means.


## What is the difference between Fine Tuning and RAG?
Both are useful ways to customize the LLM, however both have their own pros and cons.

It is very time consuming and costly to fine tune a model from scratch as it requires more computational power and additionally it is very difficult to sync this model with day to day innovation.

RAG is another powerful way to fine tune the model but actually it does not fine tune the base model but it use base model ability to analyze the new data. It is cost effective and did not require an addition computing power , moreover it can be use to analyze the current available data without updating a whole model for just a small chunk of data e.g. for a single book.
