# error = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
solution = use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost


# solution = always when you import .env file in config function then use only .env not like ../../.env


# apiroute was not written properly 

# in db have to write "select * from  public.user "


# when you do session_add and session_commit(xyz) then xyz becomes empty so you have to add session_refresh(xyz) after that
